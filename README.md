# JSL01: Kanban Board UI Implementation

Welcome to my JSL01 Kanban Board project—a responsive UI challenge that replicates the design and structure of a professional task management board using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

This project showcases my ability to implement modern, responsive layouts with a mobile-first approach, demonstrating clean code organization and attention to design details.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This challenge was part of the JSL01: Kanban Board Challenge by CodeSpace Academy.

The task was to create a fully responsive Kanban board interface that matches the provided Figma design specifications for both desktop and mobile views.

**Objectives:**

- Structure and style the page to replicate the exact design specifications

- Implement a mobile-first responsive approach

- Use Flexbox for layout organization

- Ensure pixel-perfect color, typography, and spacing matching

- Create interactive elements with hover effects

This Portfolio Project is created as part of my coursework with CodeSpace Academy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

Tailwind CSS → Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development

Google Fonts → Plus Jakarta Sans typography

Figma Design → Reference for layout, colors, and spacing

VS Code → Primary code editor with Tailwind IntelliSense

Browser DevTools → For responsive testing and debugging

## ✨ Learning Reflection

I initially struggled with the desktop layout structure, particularly separating the sidebar from the main content area. The challenge was creating two distinct sections that would work together responsively.

To fix this, I restructured the HTML to have the sidebar and main content as sibling elements within a flex container, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.

Another challenge was implementing the exact column counts and task content from the design specifications. I carefully reviewed the requirements to ensure TODO (4), DOING (2), and DONE (2) columns matched the expected content with proper emojis and styling.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Pixel-perfect responsive design matching Figma specifications
- ✅ Mobile-first approach with stacked columns on small screens
- ✅ Desktop layout with fixed sidebar and horizontal columns
- ✅ Interactive elements with hover states and transitions
- ✅ Consistent typography using Plus Jakarta Sans
- ✅ Professional color scheme matching the design system
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code with semantic HTML structure

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Open the folder in your code editor (VS Code recommended)

3. Launch index.html in your browser to view the page

4. Test responsiveness by resizing your browser window

The project requires no build process—it's a single HTML file with CDN dependencies.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints

- Structure complex layouts with Flexbox for both mobile and desktop

- Apply exact design specifications including colors, spacing, and typography

- Create interactive UI components with smooth hover transitions

- Organize code for maintainability with clear section separation

- Debug layout issues using browser developer tools

- Follow design system guidelines precisely from Figma mockups
